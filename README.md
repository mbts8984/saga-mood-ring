## Image Mood Ring
Mood Ring is a React-based image carousel, using Redux for client-side data storage and Redux Sagas for making requests to the server. The application allows the user to scroll backward and forward through a continuous loop of photos, see associated tags for each one, and add tags for each one. The application does not rely on any pre-built carousel functionality.
